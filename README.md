Loan Approval Application
Overview
The Loan Approval Application is a web-based tool that predicts loan approval status based on various financial factors provided by the user. This tool allows users to get quick insights into their loan eligibility and approval status, helping them make informed decisions when applying for loans.

Features
Instant Loan Prediction: Get instant predictions on loan approval status.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive UI for easy data entry.
Data Privacy: All personal and financial data entered by the user is handled securely.
Predict Loan Approval: The application uses machine learning to predict whether a loan application will be approved or denied based on user input.
Technologies Used
HTML: Used for creating the structure of the web pages.
CSS: For styling the application and making it visually appealing.
Flask: A micro web framework for building the web application.
JavaScript: Used for handling user interaction and smooth scroll effect.
Python: Backend code for handling prediction logic (model and data processing).
Machine Learning: The loan approval prediction is powered by a machine learning model (trained using historical loan data).
Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loan-approval-app.git
cd loan-approval-app
2. Install dependencies
You need Python 3 and pip installed on your machine. After cloning the repository, install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the application
To start the application, run the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
This will start the Flask server locally. Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to view the application.

How It Works
User Input: The user is prompted to provide financial details such as income, loan amount, payment history, etc.
Prediction: Once the user submits the form, the data is sent to the Flask backend, where a pre-trained machine learning model processes the input and makes a prediction.
Result: The prediction result is displayed to the user, informing them whether their loan application is approved or denied.
